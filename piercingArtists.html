                <img src="img/goat_normal.png" alt="goat" /><br>
                Eann [pronouns: he/him] has been piercing since 2011 and has
                been with NEXT! since the summer of 2014. He’s a friendly little
                goblin man with a passion for helping people achieve
                self-expression and giving them the knowledge to care for
                their piercings.
                <br><br>
                Eann is a big fan of cats, space, and local wildlife.
                Ask him about his three-legged cat named Davie Jones.

                <img src="img/goat_normal.png" alt="goat" /><br>
                Grace [pronouns: they/them] is an applied animal biology
                student at UBC – so please ask them about bats. Or rats. Or
                animals in general, and that’ll make them ~extremely~ happy.
                <br><br>
                Grace’s big on the monochrome opal look, so if that’s something
                you’d be interested in perhaps having for yourself, give them
                a shout on their Instagram to inquire about custom ordering
                some neat things in. They were with NEXT! 2017/2018, and is
                excited to come back and connect with both past and present
                clients.
